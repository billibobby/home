# Home Launcher - Requirements
#
# This requirements file is for the Home Launcher application only.
# Individual applications (bot/ and pc/) have their own requirements.txt files.
# Users should install sub-application dependencies separately if running in development mode.
#
# Installation:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# This only installs launcher dependencies. For full application dependencies, see:
#   - bot/requirements.txt
#   - pc/requirements.txt

# GUI framework (same version requirement as both sub-applications for consistency)
PySide6>=6.4.0
